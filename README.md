# HexSoftwares_Python_Voice-Assistant

Voice Assistant Program 🎙️💻
Overview
This is my first project as part of my Python programming internship. It is a voice-controlled assistant that can recognize user commands and perform various tasks such as opening applications, playing music, retrieving information from Wikipedia, telling jokes, and searching the web.

Features
✅ Speech Recognition – Listens to user commands and converts speech to text
✅ Application Launcher – Opens Outlook, Chrome, and Notepad via voice commands
✅ YouTube Music Player – Plays requested songs using YouTube
✅ Time & Date Retrieval – Provides real-time clock and date information
✅ Wikipedia Integration – Fetches brief summaries from Wikipedia
✅ Jokes for Fun – Tells random tech-related jokes
✅ Restaurant Finder – Opens Google Maps to show nearby restaurants

***Technologies Used***
